Before any students had arrived volunteers including myself had helped out at the front desk to check the students in and lead them into the workshop room. Also volunteers including myself had also helped to make example structures to give students ideas of how the structures they build should look like. The rest of the volunteers had helped to distribute the materials including marsh mellows and toothpicks into cups. When the students started to arrive volunteers helped out students during the lecture to focus and make sure they are well informed of the topic of earthquakes before beginning to build their structures and to test them out on shaking jello which stimulates the movement of the surface as a result of an earthquake. After students had finished two round of building structures winners with the best held structures won full cups of marsh mellows while all other student won half cups of marsh mellows. After students left volunteers helped to clean the ground tables and materials left out to make sure the rooms were left better looking than when we came.","approved"
