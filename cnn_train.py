	would achieve a perfect score by simply assigning every class to every
	input. In order to avoid this, a metric should penalize incorrect class
	assignments as well (recall). The Fbeta score (ranged from 0.0 to 1.0)

	assignments vs. the proportion of incorrect class assignments.

	With beta = 1, this is equivalent to a Fmeasure. With beta < 1, assigning
	correct classes becomes more important, and with beta > 1 the metric is
	instead weighted towards penalizing incorrect class assignments.
